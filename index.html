    <h2>Smoothing guiding curves for road mesh extrusion</h2>
    <p>
        While building traffic management game I've encountered interesting problem. I need to allow players to build
        curvy roads. This building should feel seamless for players, so they can concentrate on strategy, planning and
        management, not on where to place spline control points so that the road looks good. So let's automate some
        curves
    </p>
    <p>
        For the prototype, I decided to use some kind of mesh extruder that follows the spline path.</p>
    <p>Okay problem solved!</p>
    <p>
        Well... this is what mesh extruder gives out of the box
    </p>

        Not pretty. Curve is jagged and mesh is self-intersecting. Of course, mesh extruder just follows the path. We
        need to find the way to make that path curvy.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's not that hard to realize that instead of having one pivot point that stands on the place where our line
        takes turn, we should have two points and form Bezier curve between them. But...
    </p>
    <div>

        <img src="./smooth-curves/before-triangles.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>
        But where to put starting and ending point and control points? Further more, we need to make game follow
        player's mouse clicking and movement and our curve needs to automatically adjust based on that.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need to come up with algorithm capable of doing that. At this time we realize that our solution is going to
        require some math. Geometry, trigonometry, linear algebra, parametric functions... might sound scary for some,
        but for us! We nerds get excited when problems like this arise before us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because it's time to open GeoGebra and start looking for patterns!
    </p>
    <div>

    </div>
    <p>
        We set up our problem in GeoGebra. Note that we set up slider for the angle from B to C, so later we can test
        how our solution will look when we change that angle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now if segment that we're looking at is going to be our guide line for a mesh, we know that mesh triangles are
        going to form on both sides of it. For the purpose of our problem, we can simplify that and imagine two
        rectangles formed around those segments:
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gg-2.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>
        We take that 'w' is width of the road so it's going to be width of our rectangles as well. To form rectangles we
        will look for unit vectors that point out in the direction of segments and find vectors perpendicular to them.
        Perpendicular vectors can be found by applying rotation matrix, or by switching x and y and then making new
        formed x negative.
        <i>TBD: Show math</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        It's obvious that our rectangles are intersecting. But let's take a closer rook to the point of that
        intersection. We cab take it as a center of circular arc that touches both of our segments. In that way we would
        make a curve.
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gg-3.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>
        At this point it's interesting to show how that would look in our game engine if we had everything calculated.
        We will see how to calculate everything later, but for now let's just check how will our mesh look with a curve
        like this
    </p>

                Nice! Mesh now follows pretty smooth curve, which is promising. But now it self-intersects. This is why,
                instead of using rectangle intersection point as our arc center, we will add some length to it. When we
                finish our calculations we can experiment with that length, or we can even allow player to manipulate it
                to make curve longer or shorter. Exciting!
            <p>
            <p>
                But wait... how do we calculate where the intersection will happen? How do we find where it will touch
                segments? And the most important question, how do we make circular arc out of splines?
