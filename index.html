    <h1>Smoothing guiding curves for road mesh extrusion</h1>
    <p>
        While building traffic management game I've encountered interesting problem. I need to allow players to build
        curvy roads. This building should feel seamless for players, so they can concentrate on strategy, planning and
        management, not on where to place spline control points so that the road looks good. So let's automate some
        curves
    </p>
    <p>
        For the prototype, I decided to use some kind of mesh extruder that follows the spline path.</p>
    <p>Okay problem solved!</p>
    <p>
        Well... this is what mesh extruder gives out of the box
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/out-of-box.PNG" width="450" />
        <img src="./smooth-curves/out-of-box-triangles.PNG" width="450"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        Not pretty. Curve is jagged and mesh is self-intersecting. Of course, mesh extruder just follows the path. We
        need to find the way to make that path curvy.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's not that hard to realize that instead of having one pivot point that stands on the place where our line
        takes turn, we should have two points and form Bezier curve between them. But...
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/before.PNG" width="450" />
        <img src="./smooth-curves/before-triangles.PNG" width="450" />
    </div>
    <p>
        But where to put starting and ending point and control points? Further more, we need to make game follow
        player's mouse clicking and movement and our curve needs to automatically adjust based on that.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need to come up with algorithm capable of doing that. At this time we realize that our solution is going to
        require some math. Geometry, trigonometry, linear algebra, parametric functions... might sound scary for some,
        but for us! We nerds get excited when problems like this arise before us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because it's time to open GeoGebra and start looking for patterns!
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gg-1.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>
        We set up our problem in GeoGebra. Note that we set up slider for the angle from B to C, so later we can test
        how our solution will look when we change that angle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now if segment that we're looking at is going to be our guide line for a mesh, we know that mesh triangles are
        going to form on both sides of it. For the purpose of our problem, we can simplify that and imagine two
        rectangles formed around those segments:
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gg-2.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>
        We take that 'w' is width of the road so it's going to be width of our rectangles as well. To form rectangles we
        will look for unit vectors that point out in the direction of segments and find vectors perpendicular to them.
        Perpendicular vectors can be found by applying rotation matrix, or by switching x and y and then making new
        formed x negative.
        <i>TBD: Show math</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        It's obvious that our rectangles are intersecting. But let's take a closer rook to the point of that
        intersection. We cab take it as a center of circular arc that touches both of our segments. In that way we would
        make a curve.
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gg-3.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>
        At this point it's interesting to show how that would look in our game engine if we had everything calculated.
        We will see how to calculate everything later, but for now let's just check how will our mesh look with a curve
        like this
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gdt-1.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>
    Nice! Mesh now follows pretty smooth curve, which is promising. But now it self-intersects. This is why, instead of
    using rectangle intersection point as our arc center, we will add some length to it. When we finish our calculations
    we can experiment with that length, or we can even allow player to manipulate it to make curve longer or shorter.
    Exciting!
    </p>
    <p>
        But wait... how do we calculate where the intersection will happen? How do we find where it will touch segments?
        And the most important question, how do we make circular arc out of splines?
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gg-4.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>
        We should notice a couple of things from this picture.
    </p>
    <p>
        There's a right triangle which has a side of length $ \frac w 2 $ (half of the road width). So if we knew what's the angle
        opposite to that side, we could use trigonometry to find the distance between B and our circular arc center.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we should notice that angles $ \beta $ and $ \gamma $ are cross angles which means they are identical. Angle $ \gamma $ is
        identical to  $ \angle ABC $ since lines that form those two angles are parallel. And we know coordinates of A, B
        and C, so we can calculate $ \angle ABC $
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, there are at least two ways to prove that angle opposite to the side with length $ \frac w 2 $ is $ \frac \beta 2 $. Maybe I
        will show one of them sometimes
    </p>
    <p>
        To calculate $ \beta $, we will use dot product
        Find unit vectors $ \hat u $ (that points from B to A) and $ \hat v $ (that points from B to C). Their dot product is cosine
        of an angle between them.
        <i>TBD: show math</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        When we know $ \beta $, everything boils down to basic trigonometry. If we call the distance between B and center $ d $
        then: $$ sin(\frac \beta 2) = \frac{\frac w 2} d $$
        $$ d = \frac{\frac w 2} {\sin({\frac \beta 2})} $$
    </p>
    <p>
        Intersection will be at the distance of $ d $. We need to find direction. Since $ \hat u $ and $ \hat v $ are unit vectors we simply
        normalize sum vector of $ \hat u $ and $ \hat v $. Since $ \hat u $ and $ \hat v $. are vectors that form identical angle to $ \angle ABC $, that
        means that what we get will be half the angle $ \angle ABC $. Just the angle we need
    </p>
    <p>
        So to calculate coordinates of the intersection $ I $
        we do:
        $$ I = B+d* \frac {u+v} {|u+v|} $$
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, remember, this is not where we will put our center. We will add some variable length $ l $ to the length $ d $,
        so we prevent self-intersecting mesh. We can later experiment with $ l $ and see how it affects our curve.
    </p>
    <p>
        So our center R will be
        $$ R=B+d+l * \frac {u+v} {|u+v|} $$
    </p>
    <p>
        To find points where circular arc touches segments $ \overline {AB} $ and $ \overline {BC} $ we will again rely upon som trigonometry.
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gg-5.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>
        This time we know that distance between B and D is $ d+l $ and we know that $ \angle DBR $ is $ \frac \beta 2 $
    </p>
    <p>
        We want to find coordinate of $ D $ by coordinates of $ B $. You might think that you could also do it by coordinates of
        $ R $. But what happens when you do that? I will leave that as khm... exercise for a reader.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, basic trigonometry:
        $$ BD = \frac \beta 2 * (d+l) $$ 
    </p>
    <p>Which means that coordinate of D will be $ D = B+\frac \beta 2 * (d+l)*u $. Similarly you can find  $ E $ that's the point where our
        circular arc touches $ \overline {BC} $</p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gg-6.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>We are almost there!</p>
    <p>Now all there is left to do is add circular curve that spans from $ D $ to $ E $ and for that we have to implement Bezier
        curves</p>
    <p>
        Now allow me to pull this formula out of the thin air.
    </p>
    <p>
        $$ k = \frac 4 3 * \tan(\frac \theta 4) $$
    </p>
    <p>
        It's pretty useful formula and it calculates the distance between starting and ending point and control points
        of a curve. This formula deserves a blog post of it's own, together with Bezier curves, so if you want to know
        more there's a very good blog post
        <a href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/#circles_cubic">here</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let's examine formula: $ k = \frac 4 3 * \tan(\frac \theta 4) $
    </p>
    <p>
        As we already mentioned $ k $ is the distance between starting point of a curve and it's out tangent control
        point. And ending point of a curve and it's in tangent control point.
    </p>
    <p>
        Direction of that distance are going to be given by vectors pointing from $ A $ to $ B $ and $ C $ to $ B $.
    </p>
    <p>
        But what is $ \theta $?
    </p>
    <p>
        It's the angle between $ D $ and $ E $ where $ R $ is center of the angle.
    </p>
    <p>
        But how do we calculate it?
    </p>
    <p>
        There are at least two ways. One being dot product of unit vectors $ \widehat {RD} $ and $ \widehat {RE} $. But can we make it simpler?
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gg-7.PNG" />
    </div>
    <p>
        If we do this it becomes obvious that whenever there's angle $ \angle ERD $, there is angle $ \angle DRE $ that forms $ 360\degree $ with
        it.
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gg-8.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>
        Oh look! Line that goes through $ H $ and  $ B $ is perpendicular to the line that goes through $ D $ and $ R $. And line that
        goes through $ E $ and $ B $ is perpendicular to a line that goes through $ R $ and $ E $.
    </p>
    <p>
        Which means that angles $ \angle HBE $ and $ \angle DRE $ are identical.
    </p>
    <p>
        But $ \angle HBE $ is our angle $ \alpha $, that we took in the beginning that points from $ B $ to $ C $!
    </p>
    <p>
        That means that  $ \angle ERD = 360 \degree - \alpha $
    </p>
    <p>Now we can find distance between starting and ending point and their respective control points</p>
    <p>
        $$ \theta = 360 \degree - \alpha $$
    </p>
    <p>
        $$ k = \frac 4 3 * \tan(\frac \theta 4) $$
    </p>
    <p>For the direction, let's say that there are unit vectors $ \hat p $ that points from $ A $ to $ B $ and $ \hat q $ that points form $ C $
        to $ B $ (remember - they are directed opposite to $ \hat u $ and $ \hat v $ respectively)</p>
    <p>
        And that's it:
    </p>
    <p>
        $$ F = D + p*k $$
    </p>
    <p>
        $$ G = D + q * k $$
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gg-9.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>
        Now we have all the control points that we need to create Cubic Bezier curve. Now Bezier curves deserve a blog
        post for themselves. There's extensive <a href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/">blog post by pomax</a> that
        I already referred to in this post. But for our problem we don't need to read all of that. Until I do my blog
        post about them here's the link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYccz1Ha34"> great and sufficient
            video explanation by Guidev</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        For our current purpose we will use cubic curve formula:
    </p>
    <p>
        $$ (1-t)^3 E+ 3(1-t)^2 t G+3(1-t)t^2 F+ t^3D $$
    </p>
    <p>
        where t is interpolation parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
        And our curve is done!
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves//gg-10.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>
        If you like splitting hairs you will notice that our curve now happens before $ B $. Which should've been expected,
        because, to mix up terminologies, in point B our curve is in null space. What are the consequences, and how we
        can solve problems that arise from that, is out of scope of this blog post.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's see how our curve will look in game engine, where extruder creates mesh around it:
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="./smooth-curves//gg-11.PNG" width="450"/>
        <img src="./smooth-curves/gg-12.PNG" width="450" />
        </dv>
        <p>😎</p>
        <p>
            It is worth noting that this method works perfectly well in both 2D and 3D. The differences arise in
            calculating perpendicular vectors. And if you want to raise your road while curving it, for example on a
            curvy bridge or overpass, you might have to work with Euler angles or Quaternions.
        </p>
        <p>But cubic Bezier curve will still be applicable</p>

        <p>
            We've done quite much with this curves, but we've barely scratched the surface.
